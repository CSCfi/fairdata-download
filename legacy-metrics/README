The scripts in this directory are used for extracting and publishing legacy download event details
to metrics.fairdata.fi which occurred before publication of events to metrics.fairdata.fi became
part of the core download service behavior.

The scripts and data snapshots remain for posterity, in case they may be needed in the future for
a similar purpose.

Note that no data stored in this subdirectory include any potentially personal identifying information
and therefore does not require special privacy handling nor does GDPR apply.

Once all legacy download reports are published on metrics.fairdata.fi (or metrics.fd-test.csc.fi),
they can be validated against the extracted events. See the validate-events script for details.
